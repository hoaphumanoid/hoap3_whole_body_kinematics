# HOAP-3 whole body kinematics

This is part of the code to generate whole body movements that I develped in the [PhD thesis](http://miguelgfierro.com/docs/gonzalez-fierro2014thesis.pdf). 

It contains several examples of whole body movements and the computation of direct and inverse kinematics for the humanoid robot HOAP-3.
